# Example LEM Mod

Example LEM-ModTools repository, it has a example map inside it as well if you want to just test out the compiler

If you're actually making a map, you should replace the example map with yours

For information on how to actually use this repository, please see the [LEM-ModTools documentation](https://github.com/Legacy-Edition-Minigames/ModTools/wiki)
